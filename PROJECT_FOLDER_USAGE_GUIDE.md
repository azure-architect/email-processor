### **File Naming Convention**
- **Timestamps:** `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt` format
- **Matching Pairs:** Commit statements and project status use identical timestamps
- **Chronological Order:** Files sort naturally by creation time
- **Easy Correlation:** Find related commit and context files instantly

---

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **1. Initial Setup**

**Verify Project Structure:**
```bash
# Check if project directory exists
ls -la project/

# If missing, create structure
mkdir -p project/{commit_statements,project_status,workflows,tasks/templates,completed-tasks,templates}
touch project/commit_statements/.gitkeep
touch project/project_status/.gitkeep
```

**Initialize Core Documentation:**
```bash
# Copy templates from proven framework
cp templates/PLANNING.md project/PLANNING.md
cp templates/TASK.md project/TASK.md
cp templates/VISION.md project/VISION.md
cp templates/CLAUDE.md project/CLAUDE.md
```

### **2. First Project Setup**

**Read Foundation Documents:**
```bash
# Essential reading for project understanding
cat project/PLANNING.md      # Architecture and technical approach
cat project/TASK.md          # Current priorities and sprint goals
cat project/VISION.md        # Project goals and success metrics
cat project/CLAUDE.md        # AI collaboration guidelines
```

**Initialize Your First Task:**
```bash
# Create your first task
cp project/templates/single_task.md project/tasks/setup-development-environment.md

# Edit the task file with your specific requirements
# Add task to master_TASK_list.md
```

---

## 🔄 **Daily Development Workflow**

### **Starting a Development Session**

**1. Load Project Context:**
```bash
# Quick context loading (last session)
echo "=== RECENT PROJECT CONTEXT ==="
cat $(ls project/project_status/*.txt | tail -1)

# Session context (last 3 status files)
echo "=== SESSION PROGRESSION ==="
ls project/project_status/*.txt | tail -3 | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "=== {} ==="; cat "{}"'
```

**2. Review Current Priorities:**
```bash
# Check current sprint and priorities
cat project/TASK.md

# Review active tasks
ls project/tasks/*.md | grep -v completed | xargs grep -l "In Progress"
```

**3. Load AI Assistant Context:**
```bash
# If working with AI assistant
cat project/CLAUDE.md
cat project/session-restart-prompt.md
```

### **During Development**

**Session Context Capture:**
```bash
# Capture significant discussions or decisions
# Use project/workflows/project_status_update.md procedure

# Generate timestamped status file
STATUS_FILE=\"project/project_status/$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).txt\"
cat > \"$STATUS_FILE\" << 'EOF'
=== PROJECT STATUS UPDATE ===
Created: $(date)
File: $STATUS_FILE

RECENT COMMITS:
$(git log --oneline -3)

CURRENT STATUS:
[Description of current state and progress]

DISCUSSION SUMMARY:
[Key decisions made in this session]

NEXT STEPS:
[What should happen next]

IADPVEC PHASE: [Current phase]

BRANCH INFO:
Current branch: $(git branch --show-current)
Last commit: $(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h - %s (%cr)')
EOF
```

**Task Management:**
```bash
# Update task status
# Edit project/tasks/your-task.md
# Update project/TASK.md master list

# Move completed tasks
mv project/tasks/completed-feature.md project/completed-tasks/
```

## 🚀 **Advanced Usage Patterns**

### **Multi-Developer Projects**

**Branch Management:**
```bash
# Create feature branch with project context
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Copy current project status to feature branch
cp project/project_status/$(ls -t project/project_status/*.txt | head -1) \
   project/project_status/feature-start-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).txt

# Document branch context
echo "Feature branch created from: $(git log -1 --pretty=format:'%h - %s')" >> \
     project/project_status/feature-start-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).txt
```

**Merge Procedures:**
```bash
# Before merging feature branch
# Update project/TASK.md with completed work
# Create merge commit statement
# Update project/PLANNING.md if architecture changed

# Merge with complete documentation
git merge feature/user-authentication -F project/commit_statements/merge-$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S).txt
```

### **Large Project Management**

**Epic Management:**
```bash
# Create epic folder structure
mkdir -p project/tasks/epics/user-management
mkdir -p project/tasks/epics/user-management/completed

# Break epic into smaller tasks
# Each task follows standard IADPVEC methodology
# Epic progress tracked in project/TASK.md
```

**Milestone Tracking:**
```bash
# Create milestone documentation
cat > project/milestones/v1.0-release.md << 'EOF'
# Version 1.0 Release Milestone

## Target Date
[Release date]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All user management features completed
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Progress Tracking
[Link to relevant tasks and epics]

## Release Notes
[Feature summary for users]
EOF
```

### **Integration with CI/CD**

**Automated Quality Checks:**
```bash
# scripts/check-project-quality.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Validate project/ directory quality

echo "🔍 Checking project documentation quality..."

# Check for recent documentation
DAYS_OLD=7
RECENT_STATUS=$(find project/project_status -name "*.txt" -mtime -$DAYS_OLD | wc -l)
if [ $RECENT_STATUS -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ No recent project status updates (last $DAYS_OLD days)"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for task documentation
UNDOCUMENTED_TASKS=$(find project/tasks -name "*.md" -exec grep -L "SUCCESS CRITERIA" {} \; | wc -l)
if [ $UNDOCUMENTED_TASKS -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Found $UNDOCUMENTED_TASKS tasks without success criteria"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for architectural documentation
if [ ! -f project/PLANNING.md ]; then
    echo "❌ Missing project/PLANNING.md"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Project documentation quality checks passed"
```

## 📚 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

**1. Missing Project Context:**
```bash
# Problem: AI assistant lacks project context
# Solution: Load comprehensive context
cat project/CLAUDE.md
cat project/PLANNING.md
tail -50 $(ls -t project/project_status/*.txt | head -1)
```

**2. Task Management Confusion:**
```bash
# Problem: Unclear task priorities
# Solution: Review and update task documentation
cat project/TASK.md
grep -A 5 "## 🎯 Current Sprint" project/TASK.md
```

**3. Session Recovery Issues:**
```bash
# Problem: Cannot resume development effectively
# Solution: Use session recovery procedures
echo "=== SESSION RECOVERY ==="
cat $(ls -t project/project_status/*.txt | head -1)
git log --oneline -5
git status
```

**4. Documentation Gaps:**
```bash
# Problem: Missing or incomplete documentation
# Solution: Validate and update documentation
./scripts/check-project-quality.sh
# Update missing documentation based on check results
```

### **Maintenance Procedures**

**Weekly Maintenance:**
```bash
# Archive old status files (keep last 20)
cd project/project_status
ls -t *.txt | tail -n +21 | xargs -I {} mv {} ../archive/

# Update task progress
# Review and update project/TASK.md
# Archive completed tasks
find project/tasks -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "Completed" {} \; | \
  xargs -I {} mv {} project/completed-tasks/
```

**Monthly Reviews:**
```bash
# Review project methodology effectiveness
# Update project/PLANNING.md with lessons learned
# Refine workflows based on experience
# Update project/VISION.md with progress toward goals
```
