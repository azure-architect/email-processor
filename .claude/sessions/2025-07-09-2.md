## Current State Document
```markdown
# Project State: Microservice Template

## Current Phase
Implementation

## Last Updated
2025-07-09 18:30:00 by Claude

## Active Context
- **Concepts**: Microservice architecture, Claude Code hooks, State management
- **Technologies**: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Docker, Python, Claude Code
- **Constraints**: Maintaining compatibility with existing project structure

## Current Focus
Implementing Claude Code hooks with state management for session continuity

## Recent Progress
- Implemented comprehensive Claude Code hooks system (2025-07-09)
- Added safety controls to block dangerous commands (2025-07-09)
- Created observability logging for all agent actions (2025-07-09)
- Implemented voice notifications for events (2025-07-09)
- Added transcript capture for analysis (2025-07-09)

## Next Actions
- [ ] Test all hooks with real development tasks
- [ ] Fine-tune the dangerous command detection patterns
- [ ] Enhance session management capabilities
- [ ] Document the state management system
- [ ] Integrate with the project's CI/CD pipeline

## Open Questions
- What's the best way to summarize previous sessions for context?
- How can we efficiently restore context without hitting token limits?
- Should we integrate this with the IADPVEC methodology?

## Implementation Decisions
- Use Python scripts for hook implementation (2025-07-09): Provides flexibility and maintainability
- Implement logging as JSON files (2025-07-09): Enables structured analysis and processing
- Use text-to-speech for notifications (2025-07-09): Provides ambient awareness of agent activity

## Notes
This state management system aims to solve the context discontinuity problem between Claude Code sessions by maintaining a structured record of project state and session history.
