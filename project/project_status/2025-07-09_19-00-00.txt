RECENT COMMITS:
feat(tooling): implement advanced Claude Code hooks with safety and observability

CURRENT STATUS:
IADPVEC Phase: EXECUTE
Enhanced Claude Code hooks with state management for session continuity, implementing the Dual-Nature State System concept.

DISCUSSION SUMMARY:
- Identified a critical limitation in Claude Code: lack of session continuity
- Analyzed the state management concept from the ideas database
- Discussed how to implement a dual-nature state system with both event logs and state snapshots
- Designed a solution that maintains context between Claude Code sessions
- Integrated the solution with existing hooks for a comprehensive system

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Created a state management directory structure (.claude/state/ and .claude/sessions/)
- Implemented a current state document with project status, focus, and next actions
- Added a reference index to link to all relevant resources
- Created session record files to capture session context
- Implemented session_init.py hook to initialize new sessions with state context
- Added session_end.py hook to finalize sessions and update state
- Enhanced hooks.toml to include state management hooks
- Updated documentation to include state management features

NEXT STEPS:
- Test the state management system with real development work
- Refine the context extraction in session_end.py
- Consider adding explicit session boundary markers
- Integrate the state system with the IADPVEC methodology
- Add state visualization tools for easier navigation
