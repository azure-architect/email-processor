feat(tooling): implement Claude Code hooks for development workflow automation

CURRENT STATUS:
IADPVEC Phase: EXECUTE
Implemented advanced Claude Code hooks with comprehensive safety, observability, and automation features.

DISCUSSION SUMMARY:
- Analyzed insights from a detailed video transcript about Claude Code hooks
- Identified key features to implement: safety controls, observability, voice notifications, transcript capture, and parallel processing
- Created a comprehensive hook system with Python scripts for each hook type
- Implemented a complete logging system for agent actions
- Added voice notifications for task completion and user input requests
- Designed a parallel processing system for running multiple tasks concurrently

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Created a structured directory system with .claude/hooks/ and .claude/logs/
- Implemented pre_tool_use.py to block dangerous commands like rm -rf
- Added post_tool_use.py for comprehensive logging of all tool executions
- Created stop.py for task completion notifications and transcript capture
- Implemented notification.py for speaking when Claude needs user input
- Added sub_agent_stop.py for subagent completion notifications
- Created parallel_tasks.py for running multiple tasks concurrently
- Implemented utility libraries for text-to-speech and logging
- Updated hooks.toml with complete hook configuration
- Added comprehensive documentation in HOOKS_DOCUMENTATION.md

NEXT STEPS:
- Test all hooks with real development tasks
- Fine-tune the dangerous command detection patterns
- Consider adding more advanced parallel processing capabilities
- Integrate hooks with the project's CI/CD pipeline
- Enhance the logging system with analytics and visualization
